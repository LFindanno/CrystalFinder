NBFM Modulator + Upconverter standard crystal values finder
This software try to find a combination of crystal quarz standard 
values including the calculation of frequencies up to 7th harmonic 
for a modulator and an upconverter.
Modulator + upconverter transmitters can be made using transistors only
so no ICs, PLL, etc are needed.
